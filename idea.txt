Idea: program that will generate random integers from the ranges of 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1, 1-10, 1-12, 1-20, and 0-99.
These ranges can be combined while also accepting additional integer modifiers.
These specific ranges will be used as these are the dice ranges most commonly used in Dungeons & Dragons 5e, being the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100 respectively.
